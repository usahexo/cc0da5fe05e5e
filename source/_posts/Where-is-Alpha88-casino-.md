#   Missing casino found at Alpha88 site! 

A long-awaited casino has finally been located at the Alpha88 site, according to insiders. The casino, which had been missing for months, was found in a remote area of the site, away from the public areas.

Workers allegedly discovered the casino while making repairs to the site. "We were working on repairing some of the damage done by the storm when we came across a hidden room," said one worker. "Inside was a full casino, with all the games and machines."

It is unclear why the casino was hidden away in such a remote location, or why it had been missing for so long. Some insiders are speculating that it may have been closed for illegal activities. However, officials have yet to release any information about the discovery.

The discovery of the casino has excited gamblers and players alike. "I can't believe it's finally been found," said one player. "I've been waiting for months."

Officials have not yet said when the casino will be open to the public, but they are expected to announce more information soon. In the meantime, players are eagerly waiting to see what this new development will mean for Alpha88.

#  Alpha88 finds new home for casino! 




Alpha88, a well-known and respected online casino, is on the move. The casino has announced that it has found a new home, with plans to relocate in the very near future.
“We are very excited to have found a new home for Alpha88. This move will allow us to continue offering our players the best possible experience,” said a spokesperson for the casino.

The new home for Alpha88 will be in the well-known and highly respected jurisdiction of Curacao. This move is sure to please players as Curacao is known for its stringent licensing and regulation requirements. In addition, Curacao offers a wide range of top-quality gaming options, making it the perfect location for Alpha88.

Alpha88 has been online since 2014 and has quickly become a favorite among players worldwide. The casino offers an impressive selection of games, including slots, table games, and live dealer options. In addition, Alpha88 boasts generous bonuses and promotions, ensuring that players always have something exciting to look forward to.

The move to Curacao is expected to take place in early 2019. Players can expect the same high-quality experience they have come to know and love from Alpha88 when the casino relocates. Be sure to keep an eye on Alpha88 in the coming months for all the latest news and updates!

#  Is Alpha88 shutting down? 

There is much speculation on social media that the Alpha88 online casino is shutting down. This speculation was given credence by a message circulated on the site’s chat group which read, “Alpha88 is closing soon. Get your payouts before it’s too late!” 

The Malta-based casino has not released an official statement to confirm or deny these rumours. However, their website has been taken offline, fuelling further speculation that the site is no longer operational.

If the rumours are true, it would be a major blow to the online gambling community as Alpha88 was one of the most popular casinos around. It offered players a wide range of games as well as generous bonuses and promotions. 

It is unclear what will happen to players who have funds in their accounts at Alpha88. Some people are speculating that the casino will honour all player withdrawals, while others are suggesting that it is more likely that the casino will close without paying out any winnings. 

At this stage, it is all just speculation and we will have to wait for an official statement from Alpha88 before we know what is really happening. In the meantime, if you have any funds deposited at Alpha88, it might be wise to withdraw them as soon as possible.

#  What's next for Alpha88 Casino?

Alpha88 Casino is a top online casino that offers a wide range of games, bonuses, and other features. Although the casino is successful, there are always ways to improve and update the site. Here are some things that we can expect from Alpha88 in the near future:

1. A New Mobile App

The current Alpha88 mobile app is functional but not particularly user-friendly or aesthetically pleasing. We can expect a new mobile app with a better interface and easier navigation.

2. More Slot Games

Slot games are extremely popular among casino players and account for the majority of casino revenues. Alpha88 will be adding more slot games to its library to appeal to more players.

3. Better Bonus Terms

Alpha88's bonus terms are currently rather restrictive and can be difficult to satisfy. We can expect the casino to loosen up its terms somewhat so that players have an easier time redeeming bonuses.

4. Improved Customer Support

Customer support at Alpha88 leaves something to be desired at the moment. Players often have trouble getting in touch with customer service representatives or don't receive timely responses. Improvements in this area are sorely needed.
