#  What is the role of an estate planning and elder law lawyer?

An estate planning and elder law lawyer is responsible for helping individuals and families plan for the future. This includes creating wills and trusts, as well as providing advice on elder law issues such as retirement planning and long-term care.

An estate planning lawyer can also help executors and administrators with the administration of an estate. This may include filing probate petitions, collecting assets, paying debts, and distributing inheritances.

Elder law lawyers may also become involved in guardianship or conservatorship proceedings. In a guardianship case, the court appoints someone to make decisions about the care of a person who is unable to make decisions for themselves. In a conservatorship case, the court appoints someone to manage the finances of a person who is unable to do so themselves.
