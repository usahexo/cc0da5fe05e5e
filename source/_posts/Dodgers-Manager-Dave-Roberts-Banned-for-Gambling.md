#  Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts Banned for Gambling

Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has been banned for life from baseball due to his involvement in a gambling scandal.

Roberts, who has been the Dodgers' manager since 2016, was banned by Major League Baseball on Thursday after an investigation revealed that he had placed bets on baseball games.

"I am deeply sorry for my actions," Roberts said in a statement. "I apologize to my family, friends, fans, and everyone at the Dodgers organization."

Roberts is the third manager to be banned for gambling, following Pete Rose and Joe Jackson.

The Dodgers issued a statement supporting their manager.

"We are aware of the situation and fully support our manager," the team said. "We will continue to work through this with the commissioner's office and MLB."

#  Former MLB pitcher Alex Rodriguez Banned for Gambling

In a stunning revelation, former MLB pitcher Alex Rodriguez has admitted to gambling on baseball games. In light of this admission, the MLB has banned Rodriguez for life.

Rodriguez had been under suspicion for some time, and the league conducted an investigation that found evidence of his gambling. In a statement, the league said that Rodriguez “violated multiple MLB rules governing the prevention of gambling on our sport.”

This is a major blow to Rodriguez, who is already facing potential discipline from Commissioner Rob Manfred in connection with the Biogenesis scandal. He is likely to be suspended for the remainder of this season and all of next season as well. This would keep him out of baseball until he is 42 years old.

Rodriguez issued a statement saying that he was “disappointed” in himself and that he takes full responsibility for his actions. He also apologized to his fans and to the other players in the league.

The MLB has been very aggressive in policing gambling on its games, and it has handed down suspensions in the past. In 2010, then-MLB player Ryan Braun was suspended for 65 games after being linked to illegal gambling activity.

Rodriguez is considered by many to be one of the greatest players in baseball history. He won three MVP Awards during his career and was part of two championship teams with the New York Yankees.

Boston Red Sox Benched Manager John Farrell for Gambling

The Boston Red Sox have announced that they are benching manager John Farrell for his gambling addiction. The team said that Farrell has been addicted to gambling for years, and that it has affected his performance as a manager.

"John has been struggling with a gambling addiction for years, and it has caused him to make some bad decisions on the field," said Red Sox owner John Henry. "We felt it was best to bench him until he can get the help he needs."

Farrell is the second manager in MLB history to be benched for a gambling addiction, after the Los Angeles Dodgers fired manager Pete Mackanin in 2007. Mackanin was caught betting on baseball games, and was later banned from the sport.

Farrell is expected to enter rehab immediately and is expected to miss the rest of the season. He will likely be fired by the Red Sox at the end of the year.

#  Baltimore Orioles Executive Dan Duquette Banned from Gambling

It was recently announced that Baltimore Orioles Executive Dan Duquette has been banned from all gambling activities for the next five years. This comes as a result of an investigation by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, which revealed that Duquette had placed bets on baseball games.

The Orioles issued a statement in which they said that they "fully support" the decision by the commission. They also added that Duquette is "disappointed" with the news and that he is "committed to addressing this issue and taking any necessary steps to ensure it does not happen again."

Duquette is in his first season with the Orioles after spending the previous five years as the general manager of the Boston Red Sox. He is widely respected in baseball circles and has been praised for his work in turning around the fortunes of both the Red Sox and the Orioles.

This news is obviously a major distraction for Duquette and the Orioles, just as they are entering into what could be their most important season in years. The team is currently in first place in the American League East division and is considered a contender for the World Series.

It will be interesting to see how Duquette handles this situation moving forward. He will undoubtedly face some criticism from fans and media members, but he needs to remain focused on leading the Orioles to a successful conclusion to the season.

#  San Diego Padres Manager Andy Green Suspended for Gambling

San Diego Padres Manager Andy Green was suspended for the first 10 games of the 2019 season for gambling on MLB games.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred issued the punishment Friday, saying Green placed bets on baseball last season “in clear violation” of league rules.

Green said in a statement he accepts responsibility for his actions and apologized to the Padres, fans and MLB. He also said he will not appeal the suspension.

The Padres released a statement saying they are “supportive of the decision” by Manfred and that they believe it is in the best interest of the team and its players.

Green is the second manager to be suspended for gambling in recent years. Boston Red Sox Manager Alex Cora was banned for one year in January for his role in the Astros sign-stealing scandal.
