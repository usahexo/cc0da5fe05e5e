In addition to the traditional bets one can make on the outcome of a college basketball game, one can also wager on who will score the most points, or which player will have the best game.

#  Duke-UNC Basketball Game Now a Pick'em Following Casino Bonus Announcement 

The online sportsbook Bovada announced Wednesday that the upcoming Duke-North Carolina basketball game is now a pick'em.

The Blue Devils (22-5, 11-4 ACC) are slight favorites to win the game at home in Durham, but the announcement from the casino means that bettors are essentially splitting their money on the two teams.

Duke forward Marvin Bagley III is listed as a 1-point favorite to win the ACC Player of the Year award, with North Carolina guard Joel Berry II coming in at +135.

The Blue Devils have won each of the last three meetings against the Tar Heels, including an 82-78 victory in Chapel Hill earlier this season.

#  Will Duke or UNC Cover the Wagering Odds in Saturday's Game? 

Saturday will arguably be the biggest day in college basketball this year with top-ranked Duke taking on No. 5 North Carolina in Chapel Hill. The Blue Devils are favored by 2.5 points and the over/under is set at 157.5, so let's take a closer look at which team is likely to cover the betting odds. 

Duke was one of the last unbeaten teams in Division I before losing 103-87 to St. Johns on January 14th. However, they have bounced back nicely since then with wins over Virginia (64-62), Syracuse (78-74) and Clemson (72-63). The Blue Devils are led by freshman sensation Zion Williamson who is averaging 21.2 points, 9.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game. North Carolina has had an up-and-down season with losses to Wofford (79-75) and Texas (86-69) but they have also beaten Gonzaga (101-91), Kentucky (82-78) and Clemson (98-80). The Tar Heels are paced by senior guard Cameron Johnson who is averaging 17.7 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. 

Duke is certainly the better team but they haven't been very good on the road this year with a 3-4 record while North Carolina is 10-1 at home. The Tar Heels seem to have a bit of edge in this matchup and I would expect them to cover the betting odds as underdogs on Saturday night.

#  Final Betting Odds for Duke-UNC Show Blue Devils as 2.5 Point Favorites 

According to the most recent betting odds, Duke is a 2.5 point favorite against UNC. This game is scheduled to take place on March 2nd at 9:00 PM EST in Durham, North Carolina. 

Despite being the home team, Duke is not favored by a large margin. In fact, the odds are so close that either team could feasibly win this matchup. 

In their last meeting, UNC beat Duke 92-85. However, Duke has had an impressive season and currently holds a 27-3 overall record. UNC has been good as well, with a record of 24-6. 

It will be interesting to see how these teams perform against each other in this match up. Will Duke continue their winning streak or will UNC manage to pull off another upset?

#  Gamblers Split on Who Will Win Duke-UNC Basketball Game

Duke enters the contest as a 3-point favorite, but Carolina has won the last two meetings between the teams. The Blue Devils are coming off of a disappointing loss to St. John’s, while the Tar Heels have won six of their last seven games.

UNC is led by Luke Maye, who is averaging 18 points and 10 rebounds per game. Duke features freshman Zion Williamson, who is averaging 20 points and nine rebounds per contest.

The game is sure to be exciting, and both teams are looking for bragging rights in this rivalry matchup.
