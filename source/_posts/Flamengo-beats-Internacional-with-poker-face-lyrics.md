#  Flamengo beats Internacional with poker face lyrics

In a match valid for the first round of Brasileiro Serie A, Flamengo beats Internacional by 2-1. The victory came after a hard fight by both teams, with chances for both.

The first goal of the match was scored by Everton in the 26th minute, after a beautiful play started by Diego. Unfortunately, the joy was short-lived, as Internacional answered back just two minutes later with a goal by Rossi.

The second half was marked by a lot of intensity and few opportunities to score. It was not until the 86th minute that Gabigol managed to put Flamengo ahead for good, scoring an impressive goal from outside the area. The final whistle marked an important win for Flamengo and raised some questions about their title ambitions.

Coach Jorge Jesus stated in the post-match interview that the win is important, but that there is still a lot of work to be done. "We are starting well, but this is just the beginning. We have to keep working hard so that we can achieve our objectives."

Flamengo will now face Athletico Paranaense in their next match, while Internacional will take on Cruzeiro

#  Poker face lyrics help Flamengo stay undefeated

 Flamengo's singing striker, Lucas Paquetá, credits the team's 7-0 victory over Botafogo on Sunday to poker face lyrics that he listened to before the match.

"I listen to a lot of rap music and I try to learn the lyrics by heart. That way I can focus on the match and not let anything bother me," said Paquetá. "Before yesterday's game, I was listening to Rick Ross' 'Poker Face.' It has a lot of good energy and it helped me stay focused."

Ross' song is about keeping your composure no matter what is happening in your life. The chorus goes: "Poker face, poker face, mama just want a smoking hot boy / Poker face, poker face, da da dada dadada / Never give up, never give in / Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride / Nobody keepin' me down."

Paquetá isn't the only one who uses music as a form of self-motivation. Many professional athletes use music as a tool to get themselves in the zone. Tennis player Novak Djokovic listens to opera before big matches to get him pumped up. Basketball player LeBron James listens to gospel music before games for strength and motivation.

"I think any type of music can help you focus or get into a certain mindset," said Paquetá. "You just have to find something that works for you and stick with it."

#  Watch: Flamengo scores goal with poker face lyrics

Football is often called the beautiful game. There's something poetic and mesmerizing about watching a well-executed goal. It seems to defy the laws of physics.

There's also something undeniably badass about a player who can score a goal with a poker face.

Just ask Flamengo striker Paolo Guerrero, who scored an absolutely incredible goal against Cruzeiro over the weekend with a straight face and no emotion whatsoever. The best part? The goal came just moments after Guerrero had been substituted into the game.

It's not often that you see a player score such an outstanding goal without any celebration whatsoever, but Guerrero pulled it off in style. It's just another example of why he is one of the most lethal strikers in world football.
