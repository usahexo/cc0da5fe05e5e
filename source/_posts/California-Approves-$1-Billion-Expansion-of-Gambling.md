#  California Approves $1 Billion Expansion of Gambling

The state of California has approved a $1 billion expansion of gambling. The move is expected to create thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars for the state’s economy.

Supporters of the expansion say it will help relieve the pressure on the state budget, while opponents argue that it will lead to more addiction and social problems.

Under the new plan, casinos will be allowed to offer more games, including blackjack, roulette and poker. Slot machines will also be permitted in race tracks and airports.

The expansion is expected to generate an additional $7.5 billion in annual revenue for the state. This will help fund critical services such as education and healthcare.

Casinos have been lobbying for years for an expansion of gambling in California. The industry says it can create thousands of jobs and pump billions of dollars into the state’s economy.

#  Delaware Gambling Revenues on the Rise

Delaware gambling revenues continue to surge despite a statewide casino ban, according to new figures from the Delaware Department of Finance. Gross gaming revenue from Delaware's three racinos was up 10 percent in the fiscal year that ended in June, reaching $224 million.

That increase was due in part to rising numbers of slot machines and table games at each of the facilities. Delaware Park, Harrington Raceway & Casino, and Dover Downs Hotel & Casino all added table games during the fiscal year. Slot machine revenue increased 8 percent over the same period.

The state's share of gaming revenue was $48 million in fiscal year 2018, up from $43 million in fiscal year 2017. That amount is distributed among Delaware's three counties based on population. Kent County received the largest share at $21 million, while New Castle County received $15 million and Sussex County got $12 million.

The jump in gambling revenue comes as no surprise to those who have been following the industry. A recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that U.S. casino gaming revenue will reach $78 billion by 2021, up from $50 billion in 2016. The expansion of sports betting nationwide is expected to fuel that growth.

Nevada, which has long been the country's top gambling destination, generated more than $11 billion in gambling revenue last year. That puts it on track to becoming a trillion-dollar economy by 2023, according to research by University of Nevada Las Vegas professor Bill Eadington.

Gambling has proven to be a major source of revenue for states across the country. In addition to Nevada and Delaware, major gambling destinations include New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Michigan. Each of those states has seen significant growth in gambling revenues in recent years.

#  Florida Governor Signs Bill Allowing Slot Machines at Racetracks

On Tuesday, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed a bill into law that will allow slot machines at racetracks in the state.

Under the new law, slot machines will be allowed at parimutuel facilities, as well as jai alai frontons and dog tracks. The legislation was approved by the state legislature earlier this month.

Governor Scott said that the new law would create jobs and generate revenue for the state. "This is a great day for Florida," he said. "We're creating jobs and revenue for our state."

The move is likely to be welcomed by the operators of Florida's racetracks, who have been pushing for slot machines for years. Racetrack owners argue that the addition of slots would help them compete with casinos in other states.

Opponents of the measure, however, argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction problems in Florida.

#  Illinois Moves Ahead with Plans for New Casino 

On Thursday, Illinois officials announced that they had reached an agreement with a group of Native American tribes to develop a new casino in the state. The planned casino would be located in Chicago and is expected to bring in $400 million in annual revenue.

This announcement comes as welcome news for Illinois, which is facing a budget crisis. The state has been struggling to come up with ways to increase revenue, and the new casino is expected to help address this issue.

Governor Bruce Rauner praised the agreement, calling it a "win-win" for the state and the tribes. He also said that the new casino would create jobs and boost tourism.

The project still needs to be approved by the legislature, but it is expected to face little opposition. Lawmakers have been eager to find ways to address the budget crisis, and they are likely to support the new casino.

If everything goes according to plan, construction on the new casino could begin as early as next year.

#  Nevada Legislature Endorses Gaming Compact With tribes

CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - The Nevada Legislature has endorsed a gaming compact with eight tribes, paving the way for the agreement to be sent to Gov. Brian Sandoval for his signature.

Assembly Resolution 1, approved Monday on a 16-5 vote in the Senate and 28-13 margin in the Assembly, ratifies the pact that would give the tribes exclusive rights to operate slot machines and other casino games at their casinos.

The tribes would pay the state 25 percent of their gambling revenue, which is estimated to be about $200 million annually.

In November, voters are scheduled to decide on an initiative that would repeal the agreement and allow any Nevada casino operator to offer slot machines and table games on tribal land.
