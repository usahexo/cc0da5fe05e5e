#  Gambling Picks for Wolverhampton Wanderers FC 

The Wolverhampton Wanderers FC will play their next game against the Reading FC. This is a difficult matchup for Wolves, who will be without their injured midfielder Ruben Neves. The Royals are in good form, having picked up six points from their last three games.

Despite this, bookmakers still favor Wolves to win the game. William Hill has them at 2/5 odds, while Bet365 has them at 1/2. For punters looking to back the away side, Bet365 has the Royals at 5/1 odds.

If you’re looking for a slightly more risky bet, there are a few options available. Both teams have been scoring goals recently, so backing both teams to score could be a good choice. Coral has this market at 11/8 odds. Alternatively, you could back Wolves to win and over 2.5 goals scored in the game. This is available at 5/4 with SportNation.

#  Wolverhampton Wanderers FC Gambling Sites 

Football clubs have been known to have gambling sponsors for a while, with the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea striking agreements with online casinos. Wolverhampton Wanderers are no exception, with the Midlands club announcing a partnership with leading sports betting company SportPesa.

The Kenyan company is one of the fastest-growing in its field, and it’s easy to see why Wolves have teamed up with them. The deal is worth £25 million over three years, bonuses aside, and it gives SportPesa a branding presence at both Molineux and the club’s training ground. It will also see the firm become Wolves’ Official Betting Partner, which includes having exclusive rights to offer betting on all first-team fixtures domestically and in European competition.

Given that Wolves only narrowly avoided relegation last season, this could be seen as an odd move by the club. However, they will be looking to promoted SportPesa as a key part of their plans to regain Premier League status. They join Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur in having such an agreement in place, so there is clear precedence.

CEO Jez Moxey spoke of his excitement at the deal and what it means for both parties involved. “We are delighted to welcome SportPesa as our Official Betting Partner and excited at the potential this partnership brings for both companies. SportPesa is one of the world’s leading online betting companies and we are very proud to be associated with them. We look forward to working together to further enhance our respective brands across the world.”

SportPesa CEO Ronald Karauri is also keen on what can be achieved from the agreement. “Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club has a huge following not just in Africa but around the world and we are very excited about this partnership which will see us work together to grow our brands globally,” he said.

It will be interesting to see how this partnership develops over time, but it seems like a shrewd move by Wolves given how lucrative partnerships like these can be.

2. Study the Form

Before placing any bets, it’s important to do your research and study the form of both teams involved in the match. Look at recent results, as well as how they’ve been playing lately. This will give you a better idea of who is likely to win and by how much.

3. Keep an Eye on Injuries and Suspensions

Injuries and suspensions can have a big impact on game outcomes. Make sure you’re aware of which players are unavailable for each team so you can adjust your betting choices accordingly.

4. Use Bookmaker Promotions Wisely

Many sportsbooks offer attractive bonuses and promotions to new customers. However, be careful not to get carried away and bet more than you can afford to lose. Always bet within your budget and only use bonuses as an added bonus, not as your sole reason for choosing a particular sportsbook.
