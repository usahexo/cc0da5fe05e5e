#  What is Daub in Bingo and Why Does it Matter?

In bingo, daubing is the process of marking off numbers on your card as they are called. This can be done with a number of different tools, including a daubers - which is essentially just a marker with a long stem - or your fingers.

While some people might consider daubing to be a basic or even trivial part of the game, it can actually make a big difference in terms of your chances of winning. In fact, many experts believe that proper daubing is one of the most important things you can do to improve your odds.

So what makes daubing so important? And why should you make sure to do it correctly?

Here are a few reasons:

1. Daubing helps you keep track of the numbers that have been called.

If you're not paying attention to what's being called, you might miss out on an opportunity to mark off a number on your card. By daubing as the numbers are called, you can ensure that you don't miss any opportunities.

2. Daubing keeps your cards clean and organized.

When numbers are called, they can leave behind stray marks on your card. By daubing regularly, you can minimize the amount of messes that are created and keep your cards nice and clean. This will make it easier for you to see which numbers have already been called and which ones are still available.

3. Daubing helps keep track of how many cards you have left.

As the game progresses, it's helpful to keep track of how many cards you have left. Daubing can help with this by providing an easy way to count how many spots are still available on each card. This can be especially helpful in the later rounds of the game when there are fewer cards left to choose from.
