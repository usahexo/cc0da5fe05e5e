#  Casino Uses Eight-Sided Dice in Oktoberfest Game 

Casino personnel were seen rolling eight-sided dice in a game of Oktoberfest at the Spielbank Berlin on Sunday.

The game, which is said to have originated in Bavaria, is played with two dice and a mug of beer. The aim of the game is to roll a number that corresponds with the number of frothy mugs of beer held by one's opponents. The first person to drink all their beers then wins the game.

Casino spokesman Hans-Jürgen Schneider said that the game was being played as part of a promotional event for Oktoberfest. He added that the casino was hoping to attract new customers with the event. "This is a fun game that people can enjoy while they are here at the casino," he said.

The Spielbank Berlin opened its doors in March this year and has since become one of the most popular casinos in the city.
