#  Attorney General throws out state's case against online poker

On Monday, the Attorney General of New York threw out the state's case against three of the largest online poker companies in the world. The companies, PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker, were all indicted on charges of bank fraud and money laundering in April of this year.

The state's Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, said in a statement that he had decided to drop the case because "the licenses held by the companies permit them to operate only within foreign jurisdictions, and do not authorize them to conduct business with New Yorkers."

Schneiderman also said that his office would continue to pursue individual players who had illegal gambling activities in New York.

The decision was welcomed by the online poker companies, which had previously denied any wrongdoing. In a statement released after the announcement, PokerStars said that it was "pleased that the Attorney General has recognized that PokerStars is a lawful and licensed company."

Full Tilt Poker added that it was "grateful for the opportunity to put this matter behind us and move forward with our business."

This latest development comes as a blow to the state of New York, which had been seeking to crack down on online poker since the federal government shut down four major poker websites in 2011. That raid led to charges being filed against 11 people involved in running the websites.

#  Online gambling is finally legal: What does this mean for you?

Online gambling is now legal in the United States after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey. This decision overturns a 1992 law that prohibited most forms of gambling. The court found that the law violated the Tenth Amendment, which says that any powers not specifically given to the federal government are left to the states.

What does this mean for you? Well, first of all, it means that you can now legally gamble online. It also means that each state will likely decide on its own whether to allow online gambling or not. So far, only New Jersey and Nevada have legalized online gambling, but other states are likely to follow suit.

Online gambling has been around for years, but it has always been technically illegal. This new ruling makes it legal nationwide, and it should be a big moneymaker for the casino industry. In fact, the market for legal online gambling is expected to grow from $4.5 billion in 2017 to $9.3 billion by 2020.

So if you're interested in gambling online, now is a good time to do so. Be sure to check the laws in your state, as some states may still prohibit online gambling. But overall, this is great news for gamblers everywhere!

#  Judge strikes down law banning online gambling

On Monday, a federal judge in New York struck down a law banning online gambling. The law, passed in 2006, made it illegal for companies to offer online gambling services to customers in the United States.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest ruled that the law violated the constitutional right to free speech. She said that the law does not specifically prohibit people from gambling online, but instead bans companies from offering such services.

"The statute does not make it illegal for New Yorkers to gamble online," Forrest wrote in her ruling. "It makes it illegal for anyone — including casinos, banks, credit-card companies and other payment processors — to knowingly provide those services."

The plaintiffs in the case, which included two major casino companies and several individual players, argued that the law violated their right to free speech by preventing them from doing business with companies that offer online gambling services.

Judge Forrest agreed, saying that the law "banned protected speech without any serious justification."

The Justice Department had argued that the law was necessary to protect consumers from fraud and other criminal activity, but Judge Forrest rejected this argument, saying that there was no evidence that such activities were more common online than offline.

This is not the first time that Judge Forrest has ruled against a law related to online gambling. In 2012, she struck down a federal ban on offshore internet gambling websites.

#  Nevada court rules that poker is a game of skill, not luck

On Tuesday, the Nevada Supreme Court issued a ruling that poker is predominately a game of skill, not luck. The unanimous decision overturned a lower court’s ruling that poker was purely a game of chance and players could not be prosecuted under state gambling laws.

The case in question stemmed from the 2011 arrest of Bryan Micon, who was charged with operating an illegal gambling business after police raided his home and found him playing online poker. Micon argued that poker is a game of skill, but prosecutors countered that even professional players can lose money due to chance factors.

The Nevada Supreme Court sided with Micon, noting that poker involves both skill and chance but that the skill component is predominant. As a result, playing poker for money is not considered gambling under state law.

This ruling could have far-reaching implications for the future of online poker in the United States. It opens the door for states to legalize and regulate online poker, as well as other forms of casino gaming. Nevada has been at the forefront of legalized gambling in the United States, so it’s likely other states will follow its lead on this issue.

The battle between skill and chance has long been debated in the poker community. Some people argue that luck is everything in poker, while others maintain that good players can beat bad players over time by using their skills. This ruling from the Nevada Supreme Court should finally put this argument to rest and give poker the respect it deserves as a legitimate form of gaming.

#  New Jersey court rules in favor of online gambling

In a landmark ruling, a New Jersey court has ruled in favor of online gambling, overturning a previous law that banned the practice. The new law will allow licensed casinos in the state to offer online gambling services to their customers.

The decision was welcomed by casino operators in the state, who argued that online gambling would be a major boost to their businesses. “The court’s ruling is a major victory for New Jersey’s casino industry and for the thousands of employees who depend on it for their livelihoods,” said Dennis Drazin, CEO of Monmouth Park Racetrack.

Governor Phil Murphy also welcomed the decision, saying that it would help the state’s economy. “This is a great day for New Jersey and its economy, as well as for our casinos and racetracks,” said Governor Murphy. “I applaud the court’s decision and look forward to seeing our casinos and racetracks provide this new entertainment option to our residents and visitors.”

Opponents of online gambling say that it can be addictive and pose a risk to players’ health and safety. However, supporters argue that it is no more addictive than other forms of gambling, such as playing poker in a casino or betting on horses. They also point out that online gambling is already popular in many other countries around the world.

The court’s decision will likely result in an increase in revenue for the state government from taxes on gambling services. In addition, it is expected to create new jobs in the casino industry and boost tourism in New Jersey.
