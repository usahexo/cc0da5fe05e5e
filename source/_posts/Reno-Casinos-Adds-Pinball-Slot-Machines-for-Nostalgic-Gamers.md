#  Classic Pinball Slot Machines Coming to Reno Casinos 

Classic pinball slot machines are coming to select Reno casinos. The machines, made by local company Buffalo Gaming, are a mix of new and classic games from the past.

"We're really excited about this," said Buffalo Gaming CEO, Jason Hirsch. "There's something about these old-school games that just seems to resonate with people."

Buffalo Gaming has been in the business of refurbishing and selling classic arcade games for over a decade, but this is their first foray into casino gaming. The company has placed its machines in several small casinos in Northern Nevada and has seen considerable success.

"The response we've gotten so far has been great," said Hirsch. "People seem to really enjoy playing these games again."

The slot machines are a mix of new and classic games from the past, including favorites like Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and Elvis Presley. They also feature some classics that have been out of circulation for years, like Addams Family andSimpsons Pinball Party.

"There's something for everyone," said Hirsch. " We even have a few games that are brand new."

The slot machines will be available at the following Reno casinos: Circus Circus, Eldorado Resort Casino, Harrah's Reno Hotel & Casino, Silver Legacy Resort Casino, and Whitney Peak Hotel.

#  Reno Casinos Bring Back Pinball Slots for Retro Gamers

Pinball slots have been making a comeback in Reno casinos. These games offer a more retro gaming experience for players, and they are quickly becoming popular among casino-goers.

Most Reno casinos have at least one pinball slot game available, and some have several. The machines are brightly colored and often quite loud, making them hard to miss. They feature traditional gameplay, with players using flippers to launch the ball into play and rack up points.

The games can be found in a variety of locations in the casinos, including near the entrances and exits as well as in designated areas near the other slot machines. They are also generally grouped together, so players can easily find them if they want to give them a try.

While the games may look like traditional pinball machines, they actually work more like slot machines. Players can win prizes by landing the ball in certain slots on the machine. The amount of the prize varies depending on the casino, but it can be anywhere from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars.

Some people may be hesitant to try out pinball slots because of their resemblance to traditional pinball machines, but they are actually much easier to play than traditional pinball games. The added bonus of potentially winning cash prizes makes them even more appealing. So if you're looking for a fun and exciting new gaming experience, be sure to check out Reno's Pinball Slots!
