#  How to create Picasso-style poker chips

In this article, we will show you how to create Picasso-style poker chips using only a few simple tools.

First, you will need to gather the following supplies:

- A printer
- Chipboard or cardboard
- Acrylic paint
- Paintbrushes
- A ruler or measuring tape
- Scissors
- Glue or a glue gun

Once you have gathered your supplies, you can begin creating your poker chips. First, print out the design that you would like to use on your chips. You can find free designs online, or you can create your own. If you are creating your own design, be sure to make it the correct size – poker chips are typically 2.5 inches in diameter.

Once you have printed out your design, cut it out using scissors. Next, using a ruler or measuring tape, measure and mark the center of each chip on the chipboard or cardboard. Then, using a craft knife or other sharp object, cut a small hole in the center of each chip. Be careful when doing this – chipboard or cardboard can be sharp!

Now it's time to paint your chips! We recommend starting with a base coat of white paint, as this will provide a good foundation for your other colors. After the white paint has dried completely, begin painting the chips with your desired colors. We suggest using bright and vibrant colors for best results. You may also want to experiment with different painting techniques for added flair. For example, you could try dabbing the paint on instead of brushing it on for a more mottled look. Let the chips dry completely before moving on to the next step.

Now it's time to attach your designs to the chips! We suggest using a glue gun for this step – it provides a strong hold and is quick and easy to use. Simply place a small amount of glue in the center of each chip and attach the printed design. Hold it in place for a few seconds until the glue dries completely. You're done! Now you can enjoy playing with your very own Picasso-style poker chips!
