        <h1 id="Royal-Caribbean-to-Offer-Points-for-Casino-Comps"><a href="#Royal-Caribbean-to-Offer-Points-for-Casino-Comps" class="headerlink" title="Royal Caribbean to Offer Points for Casino Comps"></a>Royal Caribbean to Offer Points for Casino Comps</h1><p>Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. announced Tuesday that they will be offering passengers points redeemable for casino comps. Starting in December, passengers on all ships in the Royal Caribbean and Celebrity fleets will be able to earn points for their gaming activity. The points can then be used to receive complimentary services and amenities in the casinos onboard.</p>
<p>“Our guests tell us that they love our casinos, and we want to give them more reasons to enjoy playing,” said Royal Caribbean’s president and CEO, Michael Bayley, in a statement. “Now, in addition to the excitement of gaming, guests can feel confident knowing that they’re earning rewards that can provide them with special perks while cruising.”</p>
<p>Passengers will earn one point for every $10 spent on slot machines and table games. Points can be redeemed at any time during the cruise, and do not expire as long as the passenger is sailing with Royal Caribbean or Celebrity. Rewards include items such as drinks, snacks, and discounts at the casino’s retail store. </p>
<p>This new program is just one of several changes Royal Caribbean has made recently in an effort to attract more passengers. Earlier this year they announced that they would be adding more than $200 million worth of new features to their ships by 2020, including new waterslides, a roller coaster, and a skydiving simulator.</p>
<h1 id="Get-Points-Towards-Casino-Comps-on-Royal-Caribbean"><a href="#Get-Points-Towards-Casino-Comps-on-Royal-Caribbean" class="headerlink" title="Get Points Towards Casino Comps on Royal Caribbean"></a>Get Points Towards Casino Comps on Royal Caribbean</h1><p>There are a few different ways to get points towards casino comps on Royal Caribbean, and the best way for you may vary depending on your cruising habits. </p>
<p>The first way is to use your Crown &amp; Anchor Society card. As a member of this loyalty program, you earn points for every dollar you spend on Royal Caribbean cruises (including at the casino), as well as other bonus opportunities. You can then redeem these points for free casino play, food and drink, merchandise, and more. </p>
<p>Another option is to use a credit card that offers rewards specifically for gambling. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card awards two points per dollar spent on all travel purchases, including cruises. These points can be redeemed for cash back, gift cards, or travel statement credits – and many of them can be used towards Royal Caribbean cruises. Plus, if you sign up for the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card through this link , you’ll get 50,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 in the first three months! </p>
<p>Finally, many casinos offer their own loyalty programs which award free play and other benefits based on your gambling activity. Be sure to ask at the casino desk onboard or visit their website before your cruise to see if they have one – and if you’re a regular gambler, it may be worth signing up for even if Royal Caribbean doesn’t participate.</p>

Be sure to check the casino’s website or promotional materials for current offers.</p>
<p>Using Points </p>
<p>Points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including complimentary cruise nights, food and beverage credits, spa treatments, and more. The number of points needed for a particular reward varies depending on what’s being redeemed. Generally, the more exclusive rewards require more points. Players can view their current point balance and redeem rewards online or through their onboard account.</p>
<p>Benefits of Casino Play </p>
<p>In addition to earning points toward comps, playing at the casino on Royal Caribbean comes with a few other perks: </p>
<ul>
<li>complimentary drinks while playing ( alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages) </li>
<li>access to exclusive VIP areas </li>
<li>invitations to special events </li>
<li>waived fees for using the casino</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Royal-Caribbean-to-Extend-Point-Promotion-for-Casino-Comps"><a href="#Royal-Caribbean-to-Extend-Point-Promotion-for-Casino-Comps" class="headerlink" title="Royal Caribbean to Extend Point Promotion for Casino Comps"></a>Royal Caribbean to Extend Point Promotion for Casino Comps</h1><p>Royal Caribbean announced that it will be extending its promotion for casino comps. The promotion, which was supposed to end on July 31, will now run until September 30. </p>
<p>The extension comes as a response to overwhelming demand from guests. It offers guests the chance to earn $1 in casino credits for every point they earn on their Royal Caribbean cruise. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for the company said: “We’re thrilled to see such enthusiasm for our new casino program, and we’re happy to offer our guests more time to take advantage of it. We know that they’ll love the chance to earn credits they can use towards some truly amazing experiences.” </p>
<p>Guests can take advantage of the promotion by playing at any of the ship’s casinos, including slots, table games, and poker. Credits can be used for a variety of things, including drinks, shopping, and excursions. </p>
<p>The extension of the promotion is sure to be welcome news for Royal Caribbean fans. The company has been making a number of changes in recent months, including the introduction of new ships and itineraries.</p>
<h1 id="Earn-Points-Towards-Your-Next-Cruise-with-Royal-Caribbean’s-Casino-Comps"><a href="#Earn-Points-Towards-Your-Next-Cruise-with-Royal-Caribbean’s-Casino-Comps" class="headerlink" title="Earn Points Towards Your Next Cruise with Royal Caribbean’s Casino Comps"></a>Earn Points Towards Your Next Cruise with Royal Caribbean’s Casino Comps</h1><p>Royal Caribbean offers their guests the chance to earn points towards their next cruise by playing at the casino. These points can be earned through slots, table games, and keno. The more you play, the more points you’ll accumulate. You can then use these points to get free or discounted cruises.</p>
<p>The current Royal Caribbean rewards program is called “Casino Manager’s Club.” To join, head to the Casino Royale and ask a casino representative to sign you up. Once you’re a member, you’ll start earning comps (points) right away. There are two levels of membership in the club: silver and gold. As you progress through the levels, you’ll gain access to more benefits, such as exclusive promotions and discounts on cruises.</p>
<p>The way comps work is pretty simple. For every $10 you wager, you’ll earn 1 comp point. So, if you wager $100, you’ll earn 10 comp points. These points can then be redeemed for a variety of prizes, including free cruises and discounts on cruises. The number of points required for a free or discounted cruise varies depending on the cruise line and the sailing date. Generally speaking, though, it takes between 2,000 and 10,000 comp points to get a free or discounted cruise.</p>
<p>To help get you started, Royal Caribbean offers new members a bonus of 500 comp points when they sign up for the club. In addition, there are other ways to earn comp points aside from gambling at the casino. For example, Royal Caribbean partners with various restaurants and retailers throughout the United States to offer members special discounts on merchandise and food purchases. So be sure to take advantage of these partner deals to rack up some extra comp points!</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a way to score some free or discounted cruises, be sure to check out Royal Caribbean’s Casino Manager’s Club rewards program!</p>
