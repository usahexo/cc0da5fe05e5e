        <h1 id="Nevada-Leads-the-Nation-in-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-the-Nation-in-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads the Nation in Gambling Revenue"></a>Nevada Leads the Nation in Gambling Revenue</h1><p>Nevada is often thought of as a gambler’s paradise. It is the home of Las Vegas, after all. But it turns out that Nevada casinos are raking in more gambling revenue than those in any other state.</p>
<p>In fact, Nevada’s gambling revenue was more than double that of runner-up New Jersey in 2016. In total, Nevada casinos took in over $11 billion in bets last year.</p>
<p>What is it about Nevada that makes it so conducive to gambling? For one, the state has long had a permissive attitude towards gambling. It was one of the first states to legalize casinos, and has since legalized a wide variety of forms of gambling including sports betting, poker, and lotteries.</p>
<p>The state also has a number of casino resorts - including some of the largest in the world - which help draw tourists and their money to the gaming tables. And finally, Las Vegas is widely considered to be one of the most exciting and vibrant cities in the country, which helps entice people to gamble there.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a place to gamble your hard-earned money, Nevada is definitely the place to go!</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Continues-to-Lead-in-Casino-Gaming-Revenue"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Continues-to-Lead-in-Casino-Gaming-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Continues to Lead in Casino Gaming Revenue"></a>Pennsylvania Continues to Lead in Casino Gaming Revenue</h1><p>Pennsylvania casinos continue to lead the nation in gaming revenue according to the latest figures from the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). In fiscal year 2017, Pennsylvania gross gaming revenue totaled $3.2 billion, an increase of 2.9 percent from the previous year. This was despite a decline in slot machine revenue, which accounts for the majority of gaming revenue in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The growth in Pennsylvania’s casino industry is being driven by table games, which have seen a 6.6 percent increase in revenue over the past year. The state currently has 11 casinos, including two located in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>There are currently more than 1,000 casinos operating in 28 states throughout the US, generating a total of $37.34 billion in gaming revenue last year. The top five states for casino gaming revenue are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pennsylvania – $3.2 billion</li>
<li>Nevada – $2.9 billion</li>
<li>New Jersey – $2.7 billion</li>
<li>Illinois – $1.5 billion</li>
<li>Michigan – $1.4 billion</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Connecticut-Grows-its-Gambling-Revenue-by-7"><a href="#Connecticut-Grows-its-Gambling-Revenue-by-7" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut Grows its Gambling Revenue by 7%"></a>Connecticut Grows its Gambling Revenue by 7%</h1><p>According to the latest state revenue report, gambling receipts in Connecticut have grown by 7% year-over-year. This increase is attributed to the legalization of sports betting in 2018 as well as the expansion of gaming facilities throughout the state.</p>
<p>While casino gaming continues to be the dominant form of gambling in Connecticut, sports betting is becoming an increasingly popular option. In fact, the total amount wagered on sports in Connecticut during the fiscal year was $906 million – more than double what was wagered in fiscal 2018.</p>
<p>The growth in gambling revenue is good news for the state, as it helps to offset declines in other areas of taxation. In particular, income taxes and sales taxes both declined over the past year. Gambling revenue now accounts for 3% of Connecticut’s overall tax revenue, making it an important piece of the state’s overall tax base.</p>
<p>While gambling will never be a major driver of economic growth, it can play an important role in supplementing other sources of revenue. And with more states moving towards legalization, the potential for further growth remains strong.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware’s-Online-Gambling-Industry-on-the-Rise"><a href="#Delaware’s-Online-Gambling-Industry-on-the-Rise" class="headerlink" title="Delaware’s Online Gambling Industry on the Rise"></a>Delaware’s Online Gambling Industry on the Rise</h1><p>In the era of internet and mobile technology, just about anything can be done online. This Cutting Edge report sheds light on Delaware’s recent foray into online gambling and how it is benefiting the state’s economy.</p>
<p>The first state to legalize and regulate online gambling was New Jersey in 2013. Delaware followed suit in 2014, legalizing most types of online casino games. Today, the industry is booming in both states, with revenue from online gaming up significantly from where it was just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Delaware has seen a particular boost in its online gambling industry since expanding its offerings to include poker in 2016. In fiscal year 2017, the state took in over $12 million in revenue from poker alone—up from just over $2 million in fiscal year 2014. In addition to the tax revenue generated by the industry, the jobs created by it are also providing a significant economic boost to Delaware.</p>
<p>The growth of the online gambling industry is not just benefiting states like New Jersey and Delaware; it is also benefiting individual players. The amount of money won by players in regulated markets has increased every year since 2011, with over $1.5 billion being won in 2017 alone. This money is being put back into the economy by gamblers spending it on goods and services like hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues.</p>
<p>So far, only a small number of states have legalized online gambling, but this is likely to change as more and more states see the benefits that come with regulating the industry. With an increasing number of people preferring to gamble online rather than at physical casinos, it is no surprise that states are beginning to take notice.</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-Sees-Increase-in-Slot-Machine-Revenue"><a href="#Rhode-Island-Sees-Increase-in-Slot-Machine-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island Sees Increase in Slot Machine Revenue"></a>Rhode Island Sees Increase in Slot Machine Revenue</h1><p>In Rhode Island, the amount of money generated from slot machines has been on the rise in recent years. In the fiscal year of 2017, the state saw a total of $248 million in revenue from slots, an increase of roughly $10 million from the year before. This uptick is largely attributed to the opening of two new casinos in the state, Twin River Casino and Tiverton Casino Hotel.</p>
<p>The casinos are said to have created over 1,000 jobs in Rhode Island, and they have brought in more than $500 million in economic activity since they opened. In addition to the new casinos, revenue from slots has also seen a boost thanks to recent expansions at Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun Casino.</p>
<p>The fact that Rhode Island is seeing an increase in slot machine revenue is good news for the state’s economy. The additional money generated from slots helps to support important programs and services like education and healthcare. It also helps to create jobs and bring in new investment into the state.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, it is likely that Rhode Island’s casino industry will continue to grow. This is good news for both the state and its residents, as it means that more money will be available to support important programs and services.</p>
